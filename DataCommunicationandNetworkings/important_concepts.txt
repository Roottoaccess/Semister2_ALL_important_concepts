Welcome to the Data Communication and Networkings concepts......

1. The ip address is extended into 2 categories -> IPV4 and IPV6

2. In the IPV4 concept we looked at that it is been followed by the concept of ClassFull Addressing and Classless Addressing

	In the classfull addressing there are 5 classes where Ip's are supplied in the organizations
class A, class B, class C, class D, class E

	Different ranges of the classes:-
class A: 0 - 127
class B: 128 - 191
class C: 192 - 223
class D: 224 - 239
class E: 240 - 255

this is for the dotted representation like -> 192.168.2.4	


for binary representation the range are:-

class A: 0
class B: 10
class C: 110
class D: 1110
class E: 1111

and in the class A there is 1 NetID and 3 HostId
in the class B there are 2 NetId and 2 HostId
in the class C there are 3 NetId and 1 HostId
in the class D and class E there is no concept of NetId and HostID


* There are also something like the Logical Address and Physical Address

1. Logical Address are those address which are been understadable by the routers or the network devices (like in binary)
2. Physical Address are those addres which are been understadeble by us proper dotted numbers like 192.168.20.2


* One problem is there in the ClassFull Addressing is that in the ClassFull Addressing there are classes and each claass have
different ranges so like if an organisation needs 100 ip address and they have provided with class A, so the ip after 100 
will be waste so in class B and if an big organization provided with class C which has very less range to fit will again
occurs a problem so its a issue with classFull Addressing so to overcome this problem ClassLess addressing are been introduced

ClassLess Addressing -> In the concept of classless addressing the problem resolved, by observing the range of the organizatons
the ip address are provided not more or not less than that, but this are also in blocks or groups provided....

Notation: x.y.z.w/s -> where s is the marks.
suppose for example 200.10.20.40/28 , so 28 no of 1's

	32 bites
BlockID -> 28, HostId -> 32 - 28 = 4 , so 2^4 = 16 , so 16 is the HostId

so -> 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000
	
	128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1 -> (2^power)

so -> 255.255.255.240

		It is also called Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)
200.10.20.40/8
200.10.20.00101000
200.10.20.00100000

so the final result is 200.10.20.32/8 -> Network address !!

	* In the optic fiber cable the data transfer through light so it is that fast..


In a perticular network the ip's are unique....

192.168.2.1 -> Octed -> 1byte -> 8bites
