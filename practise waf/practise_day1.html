        <dd>We have discussed about the ISO/OSI layer where ISO is an organization which defines set of rules to communication from one system to another system. Then we learned about the interduction to osi layer it is the 7 layer architecture and then I have learned that in the optic fiber the data flows by the light so it is way more faster than any other things or electricity, then I learned about the bandwidth concept the more the bandwidth the more data can flow from the path, find what is the communication link and we will learn about the <mark> TCP/IP protocol </mark> in this course and more focus on it.
